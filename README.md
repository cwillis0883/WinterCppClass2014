Assignments for UW Winter 2014 Intro to C++ Programming Course

Programming with Inheritance

Let's go back the the banking account problem from previous assignments. Modify
your implementation such that you have a base Account class which provides the common
capabilities for both a CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount. Subclass CheckingAccount
and SavingsAccount from Account. Add specific capabilities as needed to the subclasses.
If your initial solution already used inheritance you can resubmit the
appropriate classes.

Note the naming style used above for the base and derived classes. A good style
is to name the base class in a way such that derived class names use the base class
name as the suffix. The name makes it easy to see the inheritance relationship between
the base and derived class.
